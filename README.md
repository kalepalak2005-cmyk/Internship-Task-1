# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end customer behavior analysis project completed as part of an internship task. The objective is to analyze customer transaction and behavior data to identify meaningful customer segments, understand purchase patterns, assess churn risk, and translate insights into actionable business recommendations.

The analysis is based on a real-world Kaggle dataset and focuses on both analytical rigor and business relevance.

## Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Customer Behavior Analysis Dataset
Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/customer-behavior-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/customer-behavior-analysis)

The dataset includes customer transaction details and behavioral attributes required for segmentation and retention analysis.

## Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw transactional data
* Engineer relevant behavioral features
* Segment customers using RFM analysis and/or clustering techniques
* Analyze purchase behavior and retention trends
* Identify potential churn-risk segments
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer engagement

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values and duplicates
   * Data type corrections and consistency checks

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Creation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics
   * Additional behavioral indicators where applicable

3. **Customer Segmentation**

   * RFM-based segmentation
   * Clustering techniques for customer grouping

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization**

   * Purchase pattern analysis
   * Retention and engagement trends
   * Segment-wise behavior comparison

5. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Interpretation of customer segments
   * Identification of high-value and churn-prone customers
   * Business-focused recommendations

## Deliverables

* **Jupyter Notebook**: Complete analysis with code and visualizations
* **PDF Report**: Summary of customer segments, key findings, and actionable recommendations

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Key Outcomes

* Clear customer segmentation based on behavior and value
* Identification of purchase and retention patterns
* Actionable insights to improve engagement and reduce churn

## Notes

This project emphasizes practical business interpretation over purely academic analysis. The focus is on how insights can be applied in a real organizational context.
